# DML-OpenProblem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [DML-OpenProblem](https://github.com/Open-Deep-ML/DML-OpenProblem/tree/main) repository.  My focus is on implementing machine learning and related algorithms from scratch, without relying heavily on pre-built libraries (wherever feasible for learning purposes).  This allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying principles and implementation details.

## Project Goals

*   Implement core machine learning algorithms from scratch.
*   Gain a strong understanding of the mathematical and computational foundations of ML.
*   Develop problem-solving skills in the context of ML challenges.
*   Contribute to the open-source learning community.
